"""The one interface every model call goes through.

A call names a pinned model, a system prompt, the user-turn text and a JSON schema, and gets back
the JSON object the model produced for that schema. Nothing else about the transport leaks out, so
moving from the Claude CLI to the Anthropic SDK changes one file (CLAUDE.md "On the Claude CLI").

What comes back is still untrusted: callers parse it with ``extra="forbid"`` models and validate it.
