"""From a sentence to a checked plan: decompose, retrieve, plan, validate.

This is the understanding half of a chat turn. The orchestrator (Phase 6) calls it, then sends a
``PlannedSteps`` plan to preflight, asks for a ``NeedsInput``, or shows a ``Refusal``. Nothing here
writes, and nothing reaches the backend except through the retriever's index and the catalog.
